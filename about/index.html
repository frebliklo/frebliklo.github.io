        <p>My educational background is in Human-Computer Interaction which has a strong influence on my design process. I put my master's degree to use in my professional life by always wanting to understand problems and ideas which I do by digging with questions. The best way to solve a problem is by understanding it.</p>

        <p>n the more technical side, I love prototyping. Framer, Principle, and Flinto are my two favorite weapons. I'm a big believer in prototyping, as this allows me to think of the user problems and development at the same time. It's a way for me to work fast and get ideas out in the hands of colleagues for discussion - and sometimes for real user testing.</p>
