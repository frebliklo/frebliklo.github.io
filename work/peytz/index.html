            <p>I joined Peytz & Co after finishing my master's degree in the summer of 2016 as a UX consultant. I got to work closely with multiple clients doing design, research and a bit of strategy.</p>

            <p>Due to my background focusing primarily on research I was brought in to do usability tests, user interviews, and analysis. However, in the first two months, there weren't many research tasks, so this is where I started to do more and more design work creating wireframes and prototypes.</p>
