          <p>In May of 2017, we were on the verge of releasing out Connected Cars. The team had grown from five to ten people, and things were moving extremely fast. We had customer support and more developers that seemed continents away from each other, and as the only UX designer in the company it was a challenge to design and document features and flows that both tech, support, and management could understand at breakneck speed.</p>
          <p>Our product lead and I worked with user stories to enforce user-centric design and it easier for our colleagues to understand the users and our train of thought. GitHub issues were provided with screens from Sketch, hand-drawing of flows and description, but the abstraction level of especially flows just didn't click with the team which slowed down important discussion and alignment.</p>

          <h3>Template</h3>
          <p>To test out the how this would work I created a flow documenting our car activation flow, which were one of the most critical flows. This was already handed over to the tech team but kept creating some small problems as it relies on integration with an older system that the danish Volkswagen dealers used to handle garage orders.</p>

          <p>Only two people in the team had access to the system which made it tricky to discuss, design and develop. And we needed something to guide the discussion between our Head of Operations and the developers.</p>
          <p>I documented the flow from customer contact to a successful activation showing all screens in high-fidelity from the design files.</p>

          <p>Feedback from the team was remarkably positive and made it easier for us to discuss features. The fidelity level made it more digestible for the support team and gave them a clear step-by-step visualization. System annotations were a great basis for discussing backend impact of features and gave the developers an understanding of what we in the product team did or didn't think about when designing features.</p>

          <h3>Result</h3>
          <p>The flow kit is still actively used in our design work for documenting new journeys and features. The real success of it is that we started collaborating better on features and have better discussions across the team.</p>
          <p>During spring we broke our necks building our react, and react-native apps at lightning speed and the flow kit started to bridge the gaps between support, product, and tech. We started working better together which I think is vital for creating great products and making that happen in our young small team is one of my prouder moments.</p>
          <p>It might not be the most groundbreaking thing as flow documentation has been done in many different ways before and is one of the core responsibilities of a UX designer, but it's my take on how it can be done and a lesson in the importance of design documentation.</p>
