        <h2 class="u-mb-sm">Connected Cars</h2>
        <p>In January 2017, I joined a Danish startup called Connected Cars, who connect cars to the cloud and offer a product where car owners can stay on top of their car's health and give them a direct channel to workshops. Car owners should have peace of mind and get technical assistance without having to understand the technical intricacies of a modern vehicle. Read more about it at <a class="inline-link" href="https://connectedcars.io" target="_blank">connectedcars.io</a></p>
        <p>The possibility to shape and design an ambitious system from the ground was an opportunity I couldn't turn down. I joined as the fifth employee - as the first designer - when the company was four months old tasked with performing user research, usability tests and designing wireframes.</p>
        <p>Since then I've drawn at least a thousand wireframes on whiteboards, designed UI for both web and mobile, learned some React and React-Native and committed production code. If you want to try it all I'd recommend a startup.</p>

        <p>I have defined user journeys for both of workshop and car owner products during the initial work on our MVP. Check out <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/work/connected-cars/flow">this small case study</a> about design documentation and facilitating discussions within the team.</p>
        <p>We launched our first MVP product, MinVolkswagen, in June 2017 and in our first year we've got three more brands and more than 60000 cars connected to our platform.</p>
