        <h2 class="u-mb-xs">Process</h2>
        <p>I like to collaborate and iterate on design problems. No two projects are alike, but on an overall level, my process is to gather enough knowledge to understand the problem at hand so that design and technology decision meet the user's needs and result in a delightful solution.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-2">
        <p>I tend to split the process into activities in the real world and "the bubble" - or whatever you want to call the office. I find that this is a great model to both give room for innovation and creativity while guiding the entire process by what's needed for both business and the users.</p>
        <p>It isn't a strictly linear process, but steps on the way from problem to product where you always can revisit the previous activities based on iterations and discussions with my team. Collaboration, knowledge, and experience are the keys to success and the path I choose to take.</p>
